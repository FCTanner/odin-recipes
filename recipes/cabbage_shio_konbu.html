    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        Cabbage Shio Konbu Salad is a simple yet flavorful Japanese dish made with crunchy cabbage squares and strips of shio konbu (salted kelp). 
        The cabbage is lightly tossed in sesame oil and seasoned with the umami-rich shio konbu, creating a perfectly balanced side dish that complements any meal. 
        Garnished with sesame seeds and green onions, this salad is refreshing, healthy, and quick to prepare.
